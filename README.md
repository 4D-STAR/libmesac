# libmesac
C bindings for MESA microphysics(++) libraries. These should allow many (but not all)
MESA subroutines to be called from C. 

# Compiling
```bash
./mk
```
During installation the currently written tests should also run. 

# Prerequisites
- MESA SDK
- MESA (must be compiled/built)
- cmake
- gfortran
- gcc

# Current Status
Currently the opacity module has a working interface and I am working on the eos module.
